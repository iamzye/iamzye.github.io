basic service area (BSA): The area containing the members of a basic service set (BSS). It might contain
members of other BSSs.
basic service set (BSS): A set of stations (STAs) that have successfully synchronized using the JOIN
service primitives14 and one STA that has used the START primitive. Alternatively, a set of STAs that have
used the START primitive specifying matching mesh profiles where the match of the mesh profiles has been
verified via the scanning procedure. Membership in a BSS does not imply that wireless communication with
all other members of the BSS is possible.
basic service set (BSS) transition: A station (STA) movement from one BSS to another BSS in the same
extended service set (ESS).
beamformee: A station (STA) that receives a physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP) protocol data
unit (PPDU) that was transmitted using a beamforming steering matrix.
beamformer: A station (STA) that transmits a physical layer convergence procedure (PLCP) protocol data
unit (PPDU) using a beamforming steering matrix.
